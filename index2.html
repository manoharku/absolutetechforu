                    <p>
                        Website marketing is the strategic promotion of a website to drive relevant traffic to the site. The goal is typically to attract people who may be interested in a company’s products or services. More traffic coming to a site means more opportunities to put your value proposition in front of potential customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of most website marketing strategies is to rank highly in search engine results pages (SERPs) through the implementation of search engine optimization (SEO) tactics, content marketing, social media engagement, and other digital and offline efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the majority of industries, pages that rank in the first SERP position get more than<font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);"> 50% of the traffic for their target keywords.</font> There’s a steep drop-off for pages ranking in the second and third positions, and pages in positions 5-20 compete for less than 5% of traffic.

                        Most people will find your website via a search engine, so it’s best to start with this channel. As the name implies, SEO is the set of methodologies used to make websites both accessible to search engines and appealing to readers.

                        If you need a comparison to traditional marketing strategies, then think of SEO like supercharged business listing in a phone book. Rather than paying for a large ad in the yellow pages, SEO tactics can help your business listing reach the top of the page where interested customers can easily spot your information. When customers have a need, one of the first things they do is turn to a search engine. SEO ensures that your business is front and center, enabling a steady flow of traffic to your website.

                    <p>
                        Never forget that the web is a network, and movement between network nodes (websites) is crucial not only to digital marketing, but to the modern global economy as a whole.

                    <p>
                        So if you think about website traffic as a form of currency, it makes sense that you would want to receive it from reputable sources. Just as you wouldn’t want to take money from a shady lender, you don’t want traffic from irrelevant or disreputable sources.

                    <p>
                        Backlinks – which drive traffic from another site to your own – are extremely important promotional tools. Credible backlinks signal to search engines that your <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">content is trustworthy and relevant.</font>

They have large audiences of social followers who enjoy the influencer’s content and actively participate in online conversations.

                    <p>
                        Influencers can help you to spread brand awareness to people who may not be exposed to your digital marketing messages in other channels. Plus, getting to know your brand through a trusted third party can accelerate movement through your sales funnel.

                        Brands partner with influencers to appeal to new audience segments and extend the reach of their messages. In 2019, influencer marketing spend is <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">predicted to more than double 2017 figures</font>, with 69% going toward B2C campaigns.

                        The average worker <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">sends and receives 121 emails per day</font>, so why not put those outgoing messages to work promoting your website?

                    <p>
                        Any email that comes from your brand’s domain name should include a link back to your website. That way, any reader who is interested in learning more about your offerings can easily get to your site without any extra steps.

                        Some have said that <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">content marketing is the only type of marketing left</font>. And while there’s certainly room for disagreement there, it’s true that content marketing is more relevant than ever.

                    <p>
                        Content provides site visitors with immediate value in the form of new knowledge and insights. For many visitors, it’s the sole reason to view your site. Keep in mind that web design plays an important role here. Great content surrounded by an unappealing user interface (UI) could cause potential customers to head back to the search results page before they can get to know your brand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want people to stay on your site long enough to absorb your messages, you need highly engaging content.

                        Marketing your website effectively requires a deep understanding of several disciplines, including analytics, modern mobile technology trends, human psychology, inbound and outbound methodologies, and more.

                        Everything you do to increase the amount of traffic coming to your site should be measured. It’s the only way to know how effective your strategies are and the only way you’ll be able to identify new opportunities to attract more visitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you implement a content marketing strategy, you’ll want to measure traffic coming to your blog articles, the number of click-throughs each one produces, the amount of time visitors spend reading the content and more.

                        More people are conducting searches, reading content and doing business from their smartphones every day. In Q1 2019, mobile search <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">accounted for 64% of organic traffic</font>, up from 57% in 2018.

                    <p>
                        In fact, Google began to use the mobile version of webpages for indexing and ranking way back in 2018.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To rank highly, webpages must be able to load fast on mobile devices and display their content in a manner that is mobile friendly. That means image optimization and dynamic site markup are essential for SEO moving forward.

                        Asking these and similar questions will inform your website design and help you develop a user experience that encourages visitors to stay longer and read more.

                        You may want to consider developing multiple user journeys for distinct buyer personas. Your Google Analytics dashboard can show you where users are currently leaving your site so you can optimize those pages.

                    <p>
                        In addition to thinking of site utilization as a journey your users take, consider other models, <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62);">such as the marketing flywheel</font>, that seek to build SEO momentum over time.

                        Conducting keyword research will help you understand how potential customers seek out information related to your offerings. This step is crucial for getting your website to rank highly in SERPs. You may be surprised to find that your customers use different words and phrases than your sales team. Understanding these fundamental differences can you craft engaging content. If your main goal is conversion optimization, you’ll need to ensure you’re hitting the right keywords at each stage of the buyer’s journey.

                    <p>
                        Email marketing is one of the most popular and useful forms of web marketing currently available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From small businesses to the enterprise, email lists are the lifeblood of sales. They can also help you pull in returning visitors with engaging content, special promotions and more.

                    <p>
                        Cold emails – messages sent to prospects with whom you have no prior relationship – require a personal touch, and a little humor, to fully engage your target audience. Your subject lines <font style="color:rgb(140,192,62;">border: should be eye-catching and succinct</font>. The best strategies use content to capture visitor emails, then reinforce that relationship with additional, more relevant content.

                        Pay-per-click ads can be an effective way to drive more traffic to your site, but they require a more substantial investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the name implies, businesses only pay when someone clicks on the ad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These days, PPC is most effective when used in tandem with another effort like content marketing, because visitors need more information than can fit in an ad before they make a purchase decision. Consider targeting different audiences with unique appeals, such as calling out unique value propositions or promoting blog posts that address different audience needs.

                        High-value web content is the opposite of fluff. It provides your audience with meaningful takeaways. Your efforts to promote your website could be in vain if visitors leave immediately. To keep them engaged, you need high quality content that educates, informs, entertains or inspires.

                        Often, marketing campaigns are structured around a central piece of content such as an in-depth eBook. For example, digital marketers might develop an ebook full of researched data and thought leadership. Then, they will build a campaign of blog posts, paid advertising, email drip messages to build awareness and encourage eBook downloads. Everyone who downloads the asset will provide their email address, providing the sales team with valuable new leads.

                        Google and other search engines are constantly updating their algorithms that identify which webpages are most relevant to keyword phrases and various other site factors. Marketing agencies maintain an updated working knowledge of SEO best practices to ensure their clients comply with the latest standards and methodologies.

                        Though many aspects of email marketing campaigns can be automated with the right technology, someone still needs to write and format engaging content. Agencies can help businesses develop and implement end-to-end email campaigns based around unique campaign objectives.
